Unit 5 Homework Assignment: Day Planner

https://sa605935.github.io/DayPlanner/

Assignment
We were instructed to design an interactive day planner. This website gives the user the opportunity to plan out a day from 9am to 10 pm. The site is fully functional and even allows the user to save the information locally. The website is also responsive and the color of the hour changes to reflect if the hour is in the past, present or future.

I was able to fully meet the criteria of this project: the planner is properly displayed when the website is open, the hours slots are all displayed when the user scrolls down the page, the hour slots are color coordinated, the user has the ability to enter an event, the user can save the event to their local storage & the events are saved until the page is cleared.

I found this assignment challenging. I was not able to change the time from military time to standard time. Although this wasn't an "Acceptance Criteria" listed for the assignment to be successful, it still was very frustrating.
